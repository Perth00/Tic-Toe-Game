# Tic-Toe-Game
This project is a modern implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed using Scala (version 2.19.12) and the JavaFX framework for a graphical user interface (GUI). By leveraging FXML, the declarative XML-based interface design tool for JavaFX, the project ensures clean separation between the UI layout and the application logic.
